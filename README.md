# loopback-examples

## Introduction

A project containing loopback examples.

The loopback documentation contains code snippets but not real examples.
Most of the example projects out there are on configuration and using the REST API.

My goal here is to document, with real examples, various extensions with a strong focus on using the Node API.


## Prerequisites

Make sure you have loopback package installed. For instructions see [loopback](http://loopback.io) or just run:

```npm install -g strongloop```
